## 1.INTRODUCTION:
Diabetes is a very common disease and beside it causes serious health problems such as fatal kidney damage or blindness; it may lead the patient to death. There is no exact cure for this disease yet but it is manageable with medication and diet. In this manner, importance of correct diagnosis of diabetes is very important to identify the diseases in early stage and take necessary precautions. There is a lot of data accumulated on this subject, as there are so many patients with this condition.
The purpose of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes or not, based on certain diagnostic measures included in the dataset. Several constraints were imposed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all the patients here are women at least 21 years old.
## 4.TECHNOLOGIES:
### 1.Numpy
NumPy is a library for Python programming language, intended to manipulate matrices or multidimensional arrays as well as mathematical functions operating on these arrays.

### 2.Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python programming language library for plotting and visualizing data in the form of graphs. It can be combined with the scientific computing python libraries
NumPy and SciPy.

### 3.Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is a free Python library for machine learning. It is developed by many contributors, particularly in the academic world by French higher education and research institutes such as Inria.

It offers in its framework many libraries of algorithms to implement, turnkey. These libraries are available to data scientists in particular.

It notably includes functions for estimating random forests, logistic regressions, classification algorithms, and support vector machines. It is designed to harmonize with other free Python libraries, including NumPy and SciPy.

### 4.Pandas
Pandas is a library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating
numerical arrays and time series. Pandas is free software under the BSD license.
