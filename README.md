There is no exact cure for this disease yet but it is manageable with medication and diet. In this manner, importance of correct diagnosis of diabetes is very important to identify the diseases in early stage and take necessary precautions.

Several constraints were imposed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all the patients here are women at least 21 years old.
